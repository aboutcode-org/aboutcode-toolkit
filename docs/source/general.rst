AboutCode Toolkit Defined
=========================

AboutCode Toolkit is a tool for your software development team to document your code
inside your codebase, typically in preparation for a product release, side-by-side with the
actual code. ABOUT file(s) have a simple, standard format that identifies components and their
associated licenses. The current AboutCode Toolkit subcommands are:

-   **attrib**: Generate a Product Attribution notice document from your ABOUT
    file(s), JSON, CSV or XLSX. You can also generate documents for other
    purposes (such as a License Reference) by varying your input control file
    and your template.

-   **check**: A simple command to validate the ABOUT file(s) and output
    errors/warnings on the terminal.

-   **collect_redist_src**: A command to collect and copy sources that have
    the 'redistribute' flagged as 'True' in ABOUT file(s) or from an inventory.

-   **gen**: Create ABOUT file(s) from a Software Inventory file (.csv, .json or .xlsx format)
    which is typically created from a software audit, and insert these AboutCode Toolkit files
    into your codebase. You can regenerate the AboutCode Toolkit files from a new
    Software Inventory file whenever you make changes.

-   **gen_license**: Fetch licenses in the license_expression field and
    save to the output location.

-   **inventory**: Generate a Software Inventory list (.csv, .json or .xlsx format)
    from your codebase based on ABOUT file(s). Note that this Software Inventory will
    only include components that have AboutCode Toolkit data. In another word, if you do
    not create AboutCode Toolkit files for your own original software components,
    these components will not show up in the generated inventory.

-   **transform**: A command to transform an input CSV/JSON/XLSX by applying
    renaming and/or filtering and then output to a new CSV/JSON/XLSX file.

Additional AboutCode Toolkit information is available at:

- See :ref:`specification` for an overview and a link to the ABOUT File specification.

- https://github.com/nexB/aboutcode-toolkit/ for the AboutCode Toolkit tools.

Key Terminology
===============
Some key terminology that applies to AboutCode Toolkit tool usage:

-   **Software Inventory or Inventory** - means a list of all of the components
    in a Development codebase and the associated data about those components with a
    focus on software pedigree/provenance- related data for open source and
    third-party components.

-   **Product BOM or BOM** - means a subset list of the components in a Development
    codebase (Software Inventory) that are Deployed on a particular Product
    Release (a Product Bill of Materials).

Using gen to Generate ABOUT file(s)
===================================

Prepare Your Software Inventory for gen Standard Field Names
------------------------------------------------------------

You should start with a software inventory of your codebase in spreadsheet or JSON format. You need
to prepare a version of it that will identify the field values that you want to appear
in your .ABOUT files. Note the following standard field names (defined in the ABOUT
File Specification), which gen will use to look for the values that it will store in your
generated .ABOUT files, as well as any additional text files that you identify, which
it will copy and store next to the .ABOUT files.

Fields Renaming and Optional Custom Fields
------------------------------------------

Since your input's field name may not match with the AboutCode Toolkit standard field name,
you can use the transform subcommand to do the transformation.

A transform configuration file is used to describe which transformations and validations to
apply to a source CSV/JSON/XLSX file. This is a simple text file using YAML format,
using the same format as an .ABOUT file.

The attributes that can be set in a configuration file are:

-   field_renamings: An optional map of source field name to target new field
    name that is used to rename CSV/JSON/XLSX fields.

        ..  code-block:: none

            field_renamings:
                about_resource : 'Directory/Location'
                bar : foo


The renaming is always applied first before other transforms and checks. All other
field names referenced below are AFTER the renaming have been applied.
For instance with this configuration, the field "Directory/Location" will be
renamed to "about_resource" and "foo" to "bar":

-   required_fields: An optional list of required field names that must have a value,
    beyond the standard field names. If a source CSV/JSON/XLSX does not have such a field or
    an entry is missing a value for a required field, an error is reported.

For instance with this configuration, an error will be reported if the fields "name"
and "version" are missing, or if any entry does not have a value set for these fields:

        ..  code-block:: none

            required_fields:
                - name
                - version

-   field_filters: An optional list of fields that should be kept in the transformed file.
    If this list is provided, only the fields that are in the list will be kept. All others will
    be filtered out even if they are AboutCode Toolkit standard fields. If this list is not
    provided, all source fields are kept in the transformed target file.

For instance with this configuration, the target file will only contains the "name" and
"version" fields:

        ..  code-block:: none

            field_filters:
                - name
                - version

-   exclude_fields: An optional list of field names that should be excluded in the transformed
    file. If this list is provided, all the fields from the source file that should be
    excluded in the target file must be listed. Excluding required fields will cause an error.
    If this list is not provided, all source fields are kept in the transformed target file.

For instance with this configuration, the target file will not contain the "type" and "temp" fields:

        ..  code-block:: none

            exclude_fields:
                - type
                - temp

Run gen to Generate ABOUT file(s)
---------------------------------

When your software inventory is ready, you can save it as a .csv, .json or .xlsx file,
and use it as input to run gen to generate ABOUT file(s). The official gen parameters
are defined here: :ref:`reference`

Here is an example of a gen command:

        ..  code-block:: none

                about gen --fetch-license --reference /Users/harrypotter/myLicenseNoticeFiles/ /Users/harrypotter/myAboutFiles/myProject-bom.csv /Users/harrypotter/myAboutFiles/

This gen example command does the following:

-   Activates the --fetch-license option to get license information from ScanCode LicenseDB.

-   Activates the --reference option to get license text files and notice text files that
    you have specified in your software inventory to be copied next to the
    associated .ABOUT files when those are created.

-   Specifies the path of the software inventory to control the processing.

-   Specifies a target output directory.

Review the generated ABOUT file(s) to determine if it meets your requirements. Here is a
simple example of a linux-redhat-7.2.ABOUT file that documents the directory /linux-redhat-7.2/ :

        ..  code-block:: none

                about_resource: .
                name: Linux RedHat
                version: v 7.2
                attribute: Y
                copyright: Copyright (c) RedHat, Inc.
                license_expression: gpl-2.0
                licenses:
                    -   key: gpl-2.0
                        name: GPL 2.0
                        file: gpl-2.0.LICENSE
                        url: https://scancode-licensedb.aboutcode.org/gpl-2.0.LICENSE
                        spdx_license_key: GPL-2.0-only
                owner: Red Hat
                redistribute: Y

You can make appropriate changes to your input software inventory and then run
gen as often as necessary to replace the ABOUT file(s) with the improved version.

Using attrib to Generate a Product Attribution Notice Package
=============================================================

Prepare an Attribution Template to Use
--------------------------------------

You can run attrib using the default_html.template (or default_json.template)
provided with the AboutCode Toolkit tools:

https://github.com/nexB/aboutcode-toolkit/blob/develop/templates/default_html.template

If you choose to do that, you will most likely want to edit the generated .html
file to provide header information about your own organization and product.

Running attrib with the default_html.template file is probably your best choice when
you are still testing your AboutCode Toolkit process. Once you have a good understanding
of the generated output, you can customize the template to provide the standard text that
serve your needs. You can also create alternative versions of the template to use attrib
to generate other kinds of documents, such as a License Reference.

Use jinja2 Features to Customize Your Attribution Template
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The attrib tool makes use of the open source python library jinja2
(http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/templates/) in order to extend .html capabilities and
transform AboutCode Toolkit input data into the final format of the generated attribution
file. ``default_html.template`` file contains text that complies with jinja2 syntax specifications
in order to support grouping, ordering, formatting and presentation of your AboutCode
Toolkit data. If your attribution requirements are complex, you may wish to study the jinja2
documentation to modify the default_html.template logic or create your own template; alternatively,
here are a few relatively simple concepts that relate to the attribution document domain.

The simplest modifications to the default_html.template file involve the labels and standard
text. For example, here is the default template text for the Table of Contents:

        ..  code-block:: none

                <div class="oss-table-of-contents">
                    {% for about_object in abouts %}
                        <p><a href="#component_{{ loop.index0 }}">{{ about_object.name.value }}
                        {% if about_object.version.value %} {{ about_object.version.value }}
                        {% endif %}</a></p>
                    {% endfor %}
                </div>

If you would prefer something other than a simple space between the component name and
the component version, you can modify it to something like this:

        ..  code-block:: none

                <div class="oss-table-of-contents">
                    {% for about_object in abouts %}
                        <p><a href="#component_{{ loop.index0 }}">{{ about_object.name.value }}
                        {% if about_object.version.value %}  - Version  {{ about_object.version.value }}
                        {% endif %}</a></p>
                    {% endfor %}
                </div>

The ``if about_object.version.value`` is checking for a component version, and if one
exists it generates output text that is either a space followed by the actual version
value, or, as in this customized template, it generates output text as " - Version ",
followed by the actual version value. You will, of course, want to test your output to
get exactly the results that you need.

Note that you can actually use attrib to generate an AboutCode Toolkit-sourced document
of any kind for varying business purposes, and you may want to change the grouping/ordering
of the data for different reporting purposes. (Here we get into somewhat more complex usage of
jinja2 features, and you may wish to consult the jinja2 documentation to reach a more comprehensive
understanding of the syntax and features.) The default ordering is by component, but In the
following example, which is intended to support a "license reference" rather than an attribution
document, the customized template modifies the data grouping to use a custom field
called "confirmed_license":

        ..  code-block:: none

                <div class="oss-table-of-contents">
                    {% for group in abouts | groupby('confirmed_license') %}
                    <p>
                        {% for license in group.grouper.value %}
                        <a href="#group_{{ loop.index0 }}">{{ license }}
                        </a>
                        {% endfor %}
                    </p>
                    {% endfor %}
                </div>

After the table of contents, this example customized template continues with the license details
using the jinja2 for-loop capabilities. Notice that the variable "group.grouper.value" is
actually the license name here, and that “License URL” can be any URL that you have chosen
to store in your .ABOUT files:

        ..  code-block:: none

                {% for group in abouts | groupby('confirmed_license') %}
                    {% for confirmed_license in group.grouper.value %}

                    <div id="group_{{ loop.index0 }}">
                    <h3>{{ confirmed_license }}</h3>
                    <p>This product contains the following open source software packages licensed under the terms of the license: {{confirmed_license}}</p>

                    <div class="oss-component" id="component_{{ loop.index0 }}">
                        {%for about_object in group.list %}
                            {% if loop.first %}
                                {% if about_object.license_url.value %}
                                    {% for lic_url in about_object.license_url.value %}
                                    <p>License URL: <a href="{{lic_url}}
                                            ">{{lic_url }}</a> </p>
                                    {% endfor %}
                                {% endif %}
                            {% endif %}
                            <li>
                            {{ about_object.name.value }}{% if about_object.version.value %}  - Version
                            {{ about_object.version.value }}{% endif %}
                            </li>
                            {% if about_object.copyright.value %}<pre>{{about_object.copyright.value}}</pre>{% endif %}
                            {% if loop.last %}
                            <pre>
                            {% for lic_key in about_object.license_file.value %}
                                {{about_object.license_file.value[lic_key]}}
                            {% endfor %}
                            </pre>
                            {% endif %}
                        {% endfor %}
                    </div>
                    <hr>
                    </div>
                    {% endfor %}
                {% endfor %}
                <hr>

In summary, you can start with simple, cosmetic customizations to the default_html.template,
and gradually introduce a more complex structure to the attrib output to meet
varying business requirements.

Run attrib to Generate a Product Attribution Notice Package
-----------------------------------------------------------

You can then run the attrib to generate your product attribution notice package from the
generated ABOUT file(s) or from an inventory (.csv/.json/.xlsx). The official attrib
parameters are defined here: :ref:`reference`

Here is an example of a attrib command:

``about attrib --template /Users/harrypotter/myAboutFiles/my_attribution_template_v1.html
/Users/harrypotter/myAboutFiles/ /Users/harrypotter/myAboutFiles
/myProject-attribution-document.html``

Note that this example attrib command does the following:

-   Activates the --template option to specify a custom output template.

-   Specifies the path of the ABOUT file(s) that use to generate the output attribution.

-   Specifies the full path (include file name) of the output document to be generated.

A successful execution of attrib will create a .html (or .json depends on the template)
file that is ready to use to meet your attribution requirements.

Using inventory to Generate a Software Inventory
================================================

Generate a Software Inventory of Your Codebase from ABOUT file(s)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

One of the major features of the ABOUT File specification is that the .ABOUT files
are very simple text files that can be created, viewed and edited using any standard
text editor. Your software development and maintenance processes may require or encourage
your software developers to maintain .ABOUT files and/or associated text files manually.
For example, when a developer addresses a software licensing issue with a component,
it is appropriate to adjust the associated ABOUT file(s) manually.

If your organization adopts the practice of manually creating and maintaining ABOUT file(s),
you can easily re-create your software inventory from your codebase using inventory.
The official inventory parameters are defined here: :ref:`reference`

A successful execution of inventory will create a complete software inventory in .csv,
.json or .xlsx format based on defined format.
