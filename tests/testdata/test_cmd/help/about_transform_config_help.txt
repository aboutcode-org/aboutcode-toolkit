A transform configuration file is used to describe which transformations and
validations to apply to a source CSV file. This is a simple text file using YAML
format, using the same format as an .ABOUT file.

The attributes that can be set in a configuration file are:

* field_renamings:
An optional map of source CSV or JSON field name to target CSV/JSON new field name that
is used to rename CSV fields.

For instance with this configuration the fields "Directory/Location" will be
renamed to "about_resource" and "foo" to "bar":
    field_renamings:
        'Directory/Location' : about_resource
        foo : bar

The renaming is always applied first before other transforms and checks. All
other field names referenced below are these that exist AFTER the renamings
have been applied to the existing field names.

* required_fields:
An optional list of required field names that must have a value, beyond the
standard fields names. If a source CSV/JSON does not have such a field or a row is
missing a value for a required field, an error is reported.

For instance with this configuration an error will be reported if the fields
"name" and "version" are missing or if any row does not have a value set for
these fields:
    required_fields:
        - name
        - version

* field_filters:
An optional list of field names that should be kept in the transformed CSV/JSON. If
this list is provided, all the fields from the source CSV/JSON that should be kept
in the target CSV/JSON must be listed be even if they are standard or required
fields. If this list is not provided, all source CSV/JSON fields are kept in the
transformed target CSV/JSON.

For instance with this configuration the target CSV/JSON will only contains the "name"
and "version" fields and no other field:
    field_filters:
        - name
        - version

* exclude_fields:
An optional list of field names that should be excluded in the transformed CSV/JSON. If
this list is provided, all the fields from the source CSV/JSON that should be excluded
in the target CSV/JSON must be listed. Excluding standard or required fields will cause
an error. If this list is not provided, all source CSV/JSON fields are kept in the
transformed target CSV/JSON.

For instance with this configuration the target CSV/JSON will not contain the "type"
and "temp" fields:
    exclude_fields:
        - type
        - temp
